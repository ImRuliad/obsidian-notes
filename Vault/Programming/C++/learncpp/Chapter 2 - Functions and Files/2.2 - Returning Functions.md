# <u> Return Values </u>
*When writing User Defined functions you must determine whether the function will return a value back to the caller or not. 
To return a value back to the caller, two things are needed.*
- The type of value that will be returned (in the function header)
- A return statement in the function body that matches the type in the function header

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int returnUserInput() {
	int input{};
	std::cout << "Enter the number: ";
	std::cin >> input;
	return input
}

int main() {
	int number{ returnUserInput() };
	std::cout << "Original Number: " << number << "Doubled is: " << number * 2 << \n;
	return 0;
}
```

> [!Danger] When program is executed, the operating system makes a function call to `main()`. Execution then jumps to the top of `main()`. The statements in `main()` are executed sequentially and then `main()` returns an integer value `0` for successful execution or `1` for error, program then terminates. 

> [!Danger] C++ standard only defines the meaning of 3 status codes: `0, EXIT_SUCCESS`, and `EXIT_FAILURE`.`
> EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT FAILURE` are preprocessor macros defined in the <cstdlib> header:
> 
> ```cpp
> #include <cstdlib> 
> int main() {
> 	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
> }
> These status codes are passed back to the OS and makes the code available to whichever program launched the program returning the status code. Makes any program launching another program able to determine whether the launched program ran successfully or not.

# <u> Void Return Values </u>
*Functions that are not required to return a value back to the caller.*

You `can` put a `return` statement like `return;` in void functions but void functions without a `return` will return anyways.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printHi() {
	std::cout << "Hi!" << \n;
}

int main() {
	printHi();
	return 0;
}
```

The second function call to `printHi()` wont compile because it has a `void` return type. It's trying to send the return value of `printHi()` to `std::cout` but it doesn't know how to handle this. The compiler will flag this as an error.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void returnNothing() {
}

int returnFive() {
	return 5;
}

int main() {
	returnFive();     //This is ok, no value is required.
	returnNothing();  //This is ok, we can call a function that returns a value and ignore that return value.

	std::cout << returnFive();    //This is ok, call a func that returns a value and use that value.
	std::cout << returnNothing(); //Compiler error, can't call a functions that returns nothing and use that value.
	
	return 0;
}
```
