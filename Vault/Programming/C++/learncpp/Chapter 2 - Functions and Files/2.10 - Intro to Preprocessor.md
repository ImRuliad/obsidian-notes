*Prior to compilation, each source code (.cpp) file goes through a preprocessing phase. In this phase, comments are stripped out, each code file ends in a newline, and it processes `#include` directives.*

> [!Danger] When the preprocessor has finished processing a code file, the result is called a `translation unit`. The `translation unit` is what is then compiled by the compiler.
> The entire process of `preprocessing`, `compiling`, and `linking` is called `translation`

# <u> #Include  Directive</u>
*When you `#include` a file, the preprocessor replaces the `#include` directive with the contents of the included file. The included contents are then preprocessed(which may result in additional `#includes` being preprocessed recursively), then the rest of the file is preprocessed.*

```cpp
#include <iostream> //replaces this with the contents of the file named "iostream"

int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
	return 0;
}
```

# <u> Macro Defines </u>
*The `#define` macro can be used to create a macro. A macro is a rule that defines how input text is converted into output text.*
- Function macros (unsafe, these can be replaced by functions)
- Object macros

---
# <u> Object-like Macros </u>
*Object macros can be defined in one of two ways.*
```cpp
#define IDENTIFIER
#define IDENTIFIER "substitution text"
```

for example...
```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define MY_NAME "Alex"

int main() {
	std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```

> [!Danger] Best to avoid macros with substitution text unless no viable alternatives exist.

---
# <u> Conditional Compilation </u>
*Conditional compilation preprocessor directives allow you to specify under what conditions something will or wont compile.*
- `#ifdef`
- `#ifndef`
- `#endif`

The `#ifdef` preprocessor allows the preprocessor to check whether an identifier has been previously defined via `#define`.
If so, the code between `#ifdef` and `#endif` is compiled, otherwise it is ignored.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define PRINT_JOE

int main() {
	#ifdef PRINT_JOE
	std::cout << "Joe" << '\n';
	#endif
	
	#ifdef PRINT_BOB
	std::cout << "Bob" << '\n';
	#endif
	
	return 0;
}
```
`std::cout << "Joe" << '\n';` is compiled because `PRINT_JOE` has been defined.


> [!Danger] Instead of `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` you can use `#if defined(PRINT_BOB)` and `#if !defined(PRINT_BOB)`

---
# <u> #if 0 </u>
*Can use this to comment out a block of code.*

```cpp
int main() {
	std::cout << "Joe";
	#if 0 //change this to 1 if you want it to print.
	std::cout << "Bob";
	std::cout << "steave";
	#endif
	
	return 0;
}
```
