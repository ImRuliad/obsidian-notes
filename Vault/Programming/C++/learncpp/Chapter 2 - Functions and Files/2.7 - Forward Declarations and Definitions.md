*If a program calls a function before it has been defined it will result in a compilation error*

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {
	std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
	return 0;
}

int add (int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}
```
> [!Danger] This would not compile because `add(..)` has not been defined yet...
> To fix this we have two options, reorder the function definitions so that `add(..)` is before `main()` or use forward declarations.

## <u> Forward Declarations (Function Prototype) </u>
*A forward declaration allows the compiler to know about the existence of an identifier before actually defining the identifier.*

To write a forward declaration, use a function declaration statement (the functions return type, name, and parameter types)...
```cpp
int add(int x, int y);
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int add(int x, int y)
int main () {
	std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
	return 0;
}

int add (int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}
```

> [!Danger] If a forward declaration is made, but the function is never called, the program will compile and run fine. However, if a forward declaration is made and the function is called, but the program never defines the function, the program will compile okay, but the linker will complain that it can’t resolve the function call.

# <u> Declarations vs. Definitions </u>
*A **declaration** tells the compiler about the existence of an identifier and its associated type information.
A **definition** is a declaration that actually implements (for funcs and types) or instantiates (for variables) the identifier.*

Heres a declaration...
```cpp
int add(int x, int y);
int x;
```

Heres a definition...
```cpp
int add(int x, int y){
	int z {x + y};        //instantiates variable z
	return z;
}

int x;        //instantiates variable x
```

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Declaration      | Tells the compiler about an identifier and its associated type information.          | `void foo();`<br>`void goo() {};`<br>`int x;` |
| Definition       | Implements a function or instantiates a variable. Definitions are also declarations. | `void foo() {};`<br>`int x;`                  |
| Pure Declaration | A declaration that isn't a definition.                                               | `void foo();`                                 |
| Initialization   | Provides an initial value for a defined object.                                      | `int x { 2 };`                                |
