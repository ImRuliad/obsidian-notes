# The problem
```
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _largest element in the array.
Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.
Can you solve it without sorting?

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

# Though Process


# Solution
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
	def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
		heap = []
		kth_largest = 0
		
		for num in nums:
			heapq.heappush(heap, -num)
		while k > 0:
			kth_largest = -heapq.heappop(heap)
			k -= 1
	return kth_largest
```
