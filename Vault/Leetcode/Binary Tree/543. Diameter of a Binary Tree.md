## The diameter of a binary tree is defined as:
- The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
- The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Code to find the diameter of a [[binary tree]].

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        max_d = [0]
        
        def dfs(root, max_d):
            if not root:    return 0
            left = dfs(root.left, max_d)
            right = dfs(root.right, max_d)
            
            curr_d = left + right
            
            max_d[0] = max(max_d[0], curr_d)
            return 1 + max(left, right)
            
        dfs(root, max_d)
        return max_d[0]
```
